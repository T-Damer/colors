            Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an
            object (or its representation in an image or display)

            determined by the difference in the color and brightness of the
            object and other objects within the same field of view. Because the
            human visual system is more sensitive to contrast than absolute
            luminance, we can perceive the world similarly regardless of the

            Contrast is the difference in luminance or color that makes an
            object (or its representation in an image or display)
            distinguishable. In visual perception of the real world, contrast is
            determined by the difference in the color and brightness of the
            object and other objects within the same field of view. Because the
            human visual system is more sensitive to contrast than absolute
            luminance, we can perceive the world similarly regardless of the
            huge changes in illumination over the day or from place to place.
            The maximum contrast of an image is the contrast ratio or dynamic
            range.
